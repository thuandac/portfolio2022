<h1>Isometric Perspective Illustration</h1>

<img src="images/camera.gif">


    <p style="color:#74C2B7";>For my second project, I chose my camera as the object I wanted to put in isometric perspective because it's something I use a lot in my daily life.</p>

 <p style="color:#74C2B7";>The process for this illustration was the most fustrating out of all my projects, I really struggled with how to capture what I saw in real life onto the screen.</p>
