<h1>Surreal Landscape</h1>

<img src="images/kitty-ritual.jpg">

<p>During the brainstorm process for this project, it was nearing Halloween so I came up with everything based around it. I love cats and think they're quite odd sometimes in a cute way and thought that a bunch of kitties doing a ritual for a giant pumpkin was perfect. 

<P> I had a lot of fun making the landscape as well, it was cool playing around with the effects to try to make the pumpkin look as if it was glowing and illuminating the forest around it. 
<p>This was my favorite project to do because I got full creative control and I got to mess aorund around with Photoshop tools.
